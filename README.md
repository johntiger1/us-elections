This is an ensemble model for predicting U.S. presidential elections.  The ensemble consists of three models that performed very well historically (538, Princeton Election Consortium and Votamatic).  In particular, each of those models correctly predicted the winner of at least 49 out of 50 states in 2012.  We briefly go over each model and discuss how they are combined into a single prediction.
